    <p>Global warming has led to extreme weather and sea level rise. 
    <br>As a result, some species on earth have adopted numerous forms of evolution and developed habitat migration to avoid extinction. </p>
    <p>Due to the expanding water area resulted from sea level rise, terrestrial animals that live close to waters have developed various features both in physical appearances and physiological organization as well as new behavior patterns to adapt to the environment. </p>

    <p>For example, frilled lizards have gradually changed their living and hunting fields, and began searching for food in shallow waters where fish and plankton are abundant. 
    <br>Their motion modeshave also gradually developed from paddling under shallow waters to swimming in water. Eventually, they evolved a biological mechanism that successfully made it possible to cross the water barrior and migrate to a new territory. 
    </p>

    <div class="Content">
    <p>As for organisms which only partially transformed morphologically but still have not yet been able to migrate to a new habitat, they turn themselves from the terrestrial into the amphibious in the process of environmental adaption. </p>

    <div class="NAME">PANGOLIN</div>

    <div class="Content1">
    <p>Take the pangolin as an example, in order to preyin waters, they have evolved waterproof scales. Their distorted scales and muscle work together to resist the ingress of water. This mechanism effectively prevents prolonged contact of their skin with water and in turn allows them to stay longer in water.
    </p>

    <div class="Content">
    <p>Reconfigured changes in a zoological food chain would also have effects on botanical ecology. The seeds of the Impatiens balsamina that coexist with pangolins in the same habitat spread to elsewhere by water as pangolins began preying in shallow waters, carrying the seeds hooked up by their scales and washed away while preying.</p>

    <div class="NAME">BALSAMINA</div>

    <div class="Content1">
    <p>Therefore, when a species  migrates to a new environment, it also develops corresponding transformation based on the environmental conditions. For instance, when meeting suitable surviving environment properties like moisture or soil, Impatiens balsamina seeds, due to reproducing reasons, transforms its schizocarp structure , so as to enlarge the explosion angle and expand the seed spreading range .
